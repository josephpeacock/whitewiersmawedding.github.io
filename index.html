            <p>The ceremony and reception will be at <a href="http://www.redbarnfarmofnorthfield.com/">Red Barn Farm</a> in Northfield, MN. Their address is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Red+Barn+Farm/@44.4273608,-93.1014427,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87f654ac96ca4737:0x6d21f33b95260b6f!8m2!3d44.427357!4d-93.099254">10063 110th St. East, Northfield, MN 55057</a>.</p>
            <p>The two of us can't wait to host you all in Northfield, the same town where we met while at Carleton College (shout out to ResLife for the freshman floor assignments). Red Barn Farm is a beautiful venue, better known to many Carleton students as the pizza barn, although they unfortunately don't serve their pizza at weddings. They do have a few animals on site - if you have allergies, you may want to come armed with an anti-histamine.</p>
            <p>Northfield is about 40 minutes South of the Twin Cities by car. There are many options for places to stay in the Twin Cities; if you're looking to stay in Northfield, we have blocks of rooms at the following two hotels, both under the name "White/Wiersma Wedding". We will have a shuttle running from Red Barn to the hotels at the end of the reception. Red Barn kindly allows guests to leave their cars overnight.</p>

            <p>As some of you might have heard, we are currently in the midst of a global pandemic. Ah, what a time to be in love! At the moment, state of Minnesota regulations allow us to hold an essentially "normal" wedding, with full capacity. We are trying to be as thougtful as possible about this, but also understand that people have different levels of comfort. In order to make that our most vulnerable guests feel safe attending, we ask that everyone who will be attending is vaccinated (with the exception of children, for whom no vaccines are currently approved). Things are constantly changing and while we are still figuring out the details, we will be adhering to CDC guidleines at the time of the wedding.</p>
            <p>We know that there may be guests who aren't able to attend (for covid-related or entirely separate reasons); we understand and would love to celebrate with you another time!</p>
